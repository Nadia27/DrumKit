# Drum Kit

A drum kit built with vanilla Javascript. 

## Built With

* HTML 
* CSS 
* Javascript 

## What I learned building Drum Kit 

* A better understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM), the DOM tree, and the four main types of nodes.<br/> <br/>
            * The Document Node - it represents the entire page and corresponds to the document object. <br/>
            * Element Nodes<br/> 
            * Attribute Nodes <br/> 
            * Text Nodes <br/> <br/>


* Caching DOM queries and what they return i.e., one element, HTML Collections, or NodeList.<br/><br/> 
          * The difference between Node List and HTML collections i.e., live and static list <br/> 
                * HTML Collections - are live list and return elements.<br/>
                * Node List - are static list that return any all kinds of nodes.<br/>
